#Pure CSS Accordion

##Intro

A CSS Animation Demo

##What all does it have?

It's made using basic CSS techiniques like

1. Keyframe Animations
2. Transforms

##Why it was made?

The product created here is due to an accident. I was trying to recreate something made by Chris Coyer.
And then I didn't have the link to that page and forgot what it looked like. So THIS happened :)
